# Fuck My SVG Up!
If you need to fuck an SVG up, fuckMySVGUp will fuck your SVG up

### Wha?
This is a quick and dirty python script that takes an SVG and smashes it up. Nothing clever but quite nice.

### How?
- Get the source
- Stick an SVG somewhere
- Run something like `python fuckMySVGUp.py kitty.svg output 10 NORMAL`
- Arguments are: input SVG, output folder for glitches, number of outputs, intensity (currently does nothing but needed to run)

### Notes
- This is very brute force and sometimes makes wonky sized or entirely broken outputs
- I don't care.
- Enjoy!
